Hi people!

I collected some goodies for you. I hope you like them 🙂.

**Here are some links for you:**

1. This static site generates an html page for any tweet you choose, on-demand. (<https://static-tweet.vercel.app>)
2. Josh Comeau is a talented developer, designer and blogger. His article 📝 "<a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/">How I Built My Blog</a>" doesn't disappoint. It's always nice to explore someone else's development process.
3. Lynx 2.0, a text-only web browser, was one of the first ever browsers ([post](https://fosstodon.org/web/statuses/106095054356402216"))
4. I listened to 🎙️ [a podcast](https://www.20k.org/episodes/minecraft) about the music of minecraft
5. The song 🎶 "[A Cappella 101](https://songwhip.com/fundamentallysound/a-cappella-101/)" is a fun introduction to vocal music

**Next, a nice quote:**

> "We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."<br>
