Judaism does not have a conventional day-of-rest. The Jewish week is comprised of 6 days of physical work, followed by 1 day (Saturday) of spiritual/mental work. The Jewish sabbath is by no means a throwaway 24-hours.

That doesn't mean you should be exhausted constantly. It simply means you should practice [[productive relaxation]].

I'm Jewish, and this note is part of an effort to [[practice religion in public]].
