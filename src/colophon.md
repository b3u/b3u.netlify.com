# Colophon

_This page was inspired by [Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design), who has something similar on his site._

This site began in 2018, and the design has changed a lot over the years. The 2nd and 3rd iterations are [on GitHub Pages](https://b3u.github.io/archives), just in case someone wants to see them. The current version was originally conceived in December of 2019, and implemented slowly over the following months.

I used [Figma](https://figma.com) to design the site. Figma is a web app, so you can open your files on any computer (including Linux). Plus, their free tier is perfect for my needs. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CERO1a9U7dVXyCm9p2tqnp/Binyam.in).

I decided on a minimalist design. I chose the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter) font, and [a Minor Third type-scale](https://type-scale.com/?scale=1.200). I don't know much about typography, and type-scales seem professional. The accent color is always some variation of winter green.

I recently switched from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [11ty](https://11ty.dev), because [11ty] uses JavaScript plugins. I examined a few free hosting services, and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) seemed the most powerful.
