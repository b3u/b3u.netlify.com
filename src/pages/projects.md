## Notes
A gallery of projects I've designed or coded.

**Layout/Format (grid)**
- ul - too much text would make it hard to consume content
- text w/t headings and paragraphs - text-heavy is fine; only works with a small number of items
- grid - scales well; text sits in the grid-item component

**Item Component**
- categories, so you can filter it
