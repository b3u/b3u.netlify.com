# Wishlist

{% callout "info" %}
I prefer to save towards more expensive products, rather than receive similar items of lesser quality. I appreciate $25 towards a $125 item.
{% endcallout %}

## Tech

* Comfortable desk chair, for daily use. Not much of a preference.
* Desk - Cheap is fine here, but I want leg-room. For example, I like [the Afsar Desk](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/ebern-designs-afsar-desk-w004291310.html?piid%5B0%5D=156502133&piid%5B1%5D=156502129) on Wayfair.
* A portable monitor would be handy when I'm not at home. I like the [Lepow 15.6” HD Portable Monitor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V1SQ966) ($188.98).
* Desktop speaker - The [FIODIO Mini Soundbar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0861TF8B2) ($32) is cheap and fully-featured.

## Books

* [The Hirsch Chumash](https://www.feldheim.com/the-hirsch-chumash-complete-set.html) ($200) - Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch's classic torah commentary
* Rambam’s Mishnah Torah ([Frankel Edition](https://shabsifrankel.com/collections/custom-collection/products/yad-shabsi-condensed-edition) - $116)
* ["Refractoring UI" (e-book)](https://refactoringui.com/book) ($79) - Design good-looking websites and apps.
* See [my reading list](/reading#future) for a bunch of cheaper options.

## Other

* [Ryan Tedder's songwriting course](https://monthly.com/ryan-tedder-songwriting?friend=moshe-siegel) ($279)
* Quality headphones - Sony or Skullcandy brand. Not wireless. $20 - $50.
* Outdoor slippers (moccasins), for regular use
* World peace. I can't find this on amazon...
