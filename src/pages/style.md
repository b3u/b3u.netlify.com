# Styles

My "brand" is a visual representation of my personality and goals. I would like to be formal, clean, and sensible. Another value I'd like to display is friendliness. I want to be kind, warm, and inviting. This dichotomy of logic and emotion influences all my decisions, and my brand should reflect that.

For the text, I want to be precise and neat, yet warm and inviting. [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) seems fitting, and I really wanted it as my primary typeface. It wasn't designed for body text, so I decided to use it as an accent font instead. For the body, I chose [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), as it's simple, popular, and doesn't call attention to itself.

A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, “to write beside” or “written beside”) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.

## Block-level Elements
```js
function foo(bar) {
    return bar;
}
```

{% callout "info" %}
This is a callout. It can contain a lot of text; so much so that it continues on a new line.

Sometimes, you need another paragraph.
{% endcallout %}

<button class="btn">Button</button>
