- "How to write a great tweet"
- 1. Pack a lot of info in small place. Concise, compressed
- 2. Don't spam. Don't tag, or use hashtags. Don't try to advertise, write quality content instead
    - A tweet should have no more than two hashtags or links total
- 3. People don't read twitter, they skim it. Make your content simple to understand.
- 4. Find something new, interesting and surprising. Expose it.
