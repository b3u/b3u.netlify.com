# [[David Perell]] on Writing More
Tagged with #tweets, #writing-tips

- If you want to write more, I have some ideas for you.
- Here are my favorite strategies to instantly improve your writing:
    - 1. If you're stuck, write a summary.
        - Summarize long books and complicated papers. By doing so, you’ll learn fast and attract a smart audience of readers.
    - 2. Write about what you’re excited about.
        - You don’t need a long-term writing plan. Just write about what excites you. "Writing a novel is like driving a car at night. You can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way." — E.L. Doctorow
    - 3. Connect the known with the unknown.
        - You know more than you think you know. But as humans, we over-value the things we don’t have and under-value what we have in abundance.
        - Start with what you know. Then, connect your existing knowledge with a new topic you want to explore.
    - 4. Count the essays you’ve published, not the books you’ve read.
        - What gets measured gets managed. Obsess over the number of articles you publish and you will publish more. The number of books you read is a vanity metric, so create as often as you consume.

    - 5. Stop trying to be original.
        - You can build an audience and create tremendous value for the world by building upon other people’s ideas. My favorite example is [@FarnamStreet](https://twitter.com/FarnamStreet), an intellectual treasure inspired by Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett.
        - Everything is a remix.
    - 6. Build a note-taking system.
        - If you can’t write, don’t read another writing book. Build a note-taking system first. Save all your best ideas, so you can build an arsenal of ideas so big that you can’t help but write. A good note-taking system is a creative superpower.
    - 7. Sprint, Don’t Jog
        - If you want to be prolific, writing fast is as important as writing well. Whenever you write, set an ambitious word count and a 60-minute timer. When the timer goes off, stop writing. If you give yourself too much time to write, you will procrastinate.
    - 8. Distract yourself
        - Spend less time typing. Your best ideas will come while you’re being “unproductive.” They’ll pop into your mind when you’re relaxing or talking to a friend. Curate your best ideas when you’re away from the computer, so you can be efficient when you sit down.
    - 9. Your first articles won’t be good. That's okay.
        - When you start writing, the quality of your prose will fall short of your ambitions. But your writing will improve if you publish consistently, listen to feedback, and chase the horizon of perfection.

    - 10. Once you sit down at your computer, it's time to focus.
        - People under-estimate what they can achieve with 2 hours of focused writing and over-estimate what they can achieve with 10 hours of unfocused writing.
        - No phone. No interruptions.
