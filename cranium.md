# Cranium

The cranium is where I collect my ideas.

Fair warning: I'm still [[creating my digital garden]], so things may break.

* I believe in [[productive relaxation]].
* If you want to [[creating ideas|be creative]], surround yourself with other creative people. Your environment has a huge impact on you.
* Life is full of dialectics
