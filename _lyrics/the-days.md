**[Verse 1: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
Under the tree where the grass don't grow<br>
We made a promise to never get old<br>
You had a chance and you took it on me<br>
And I made a promise that I couldn't keep

**[Pre-Chorus: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
Heartache, heartbreaks all over town<br>
But something flipped like a switch when you came around<br>
And I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together<br>
(Oh whoa oh)

**[Chorus 1: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
On days like these who could ask for more<br>
Keep them coming 'cause we're not done yet<br>
These are the days we won't regret<br>
These are the days we won't forget<br>
These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
Rattle the cage and slam that door<br>
And the world is calling us but not just yet<br>
These are the days we won't regret<br>
These are the days we won't forget

**[Verse 2: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
Out on the midnight the wild ones howl<br>
The last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel<br>
We used to believe we were stars aligned<br>
You made a wish and I fell out of<br>

**[Pre-Chorus: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
Time flew, cut through all over town<br>
You made me bleed when I look up and you're not around<br>
But I'm in pieces, pick me up and put me together<br>
(Oh whoa oh)<br>

**[Chorus 2: Avicii & Robbie Williams]**<br>
These are the days we've been waiting for<br>
Neither of us knows what's in store<br>
You just roll your window down and place your bets<br>
These are the days we won't regret<br>
These are the days we'll never forget<br>
And these are the days (these are the days)<br>
And these are the days (these are the days)

**[Instrumental]**
