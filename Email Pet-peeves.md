1. Emails are not websites

Pictures, buttons, and borders are often a bad idea, as they makes you look more branded and less personal.

Some good examples are James Clear's and David Perell's Newsletters. David Perell uses pictures very effectively.

2. Try not to track users

Let the user know what the url is, so they don't need to blindly trust that it's not a dangerous link.

A good compromise is to indicate the website on which the article can be found. [Frontend Focus](frontendfoc.us) puts the website in a `title` html attribute on their links.

3. Emails are letters

Most newsletters I actually read start with a greeting such as "Hi there", and end with the sender's name. You don't need the subscriber's name to talk directly to their heart.

In one episode of [SyntaxFm](syntax.fm), Wes Bos (or was it Scott Tolinski) said that he literally opened up gmail each time he wrote a promotional email. People like it when other people connect with them.

4. Admit stuff

When you are honest to your own detriment, you build others' trust and confidence.

In a recent newsletter, Cullin McGrath revealed his subscriber count. Because it seemed small to me, I knew he was legit. He wasn't reaching for praise; he wanted to share his ideas and opinions.

5. Emails are not blog posts
