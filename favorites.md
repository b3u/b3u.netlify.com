<!-- (Text from <https://perell.com/reccomendations>)
I’m on a mission to use the internet to accelerate the spread of interesting ideas.  

What follows is a collection of my favorite books, blogs, podcasts, and videos. I’ve spent years and years collecting these links and now, I’m excited to share the best of the best with you. 

In this collection, I brought together my favorite things on the internet and sprinkled in my own work too. I hope this page will help you spend more time learning and less time searching.  -->

1. David Perell has a [a great article](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online) about writing online.
