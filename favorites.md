1. David Perell has a [a great article](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online) about writing online.
2. [*Letters to a Young Writer*](https://amzn.com/0399590803), by Colum McCann, is a collection of fifty-two short essays on all sorts of writing. Every one of the essays is inspiring, eloquent, and funny.
3. [Neil Gaiman](https://neilgaiman.com), one of my favorite authors, wrote about [how he gets his ideas](https://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F).
4. Paul Graham has a short essay on tone-of-voice called ["Write Like You Talk"](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)
